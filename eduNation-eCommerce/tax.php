Shipping charges may also be subject to tax in certain states. Best Buy is required to collect tax in all states where we have a physical presence. You can estimate your sales tax by entering your ZIP code in your cart.</p>

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website with business partners or other third parties. For example, we may tell a partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of customers bought Z number of a certain product, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
